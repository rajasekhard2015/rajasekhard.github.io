# X-Sense Overview

X-Sense is an ‘Extra Identity Sense’, proving extra intelligence about identity factor, which can totally mitigate MitM consequences. X-Sense is ultra-scalable, highly secure and also quantum resistant. The solution works as a stand-alone authentication or as a derivative factor of other authentication factors.

X-Sense is built on <b> Ensurity’s patented  cryptography technique — Non-Linear Secret Sharing (NLSS) </b>, which is a practical, efficient and highly secure alternative to existing linear-based cryptography authentication solutions. 

As advances in quantum computing are now rapid, technology researchers indicate that PKI and other Suite-B cryptography methods are under threat from Quantum computers within 10 years (e.g. Shor algorithm). <b> Ensurity’s NLSS </b> is post-quantum secure.

X-Sense helps enterprises in eliminating the insecure & expensive password management systems with its NLSS technique, which is cheating-immune, tokenizes at image level (deep secure tokens with customization at different pixel resolution) and uses Challenge-Response mechanism to complete the passwordless authentication (the linear secret sharing method lacks the challenge-response mechanism).
